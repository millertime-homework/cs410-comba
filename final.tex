\paragraph{1. Consider building a network in the following way. Given $n$ machines, insert an edge between any pair of machines with probability $p = c/n$ for some $c \leq n$. For what value of $c$ is the expected number of edges $(n - 1)$? For this $c$, give the best upper bound you can on the probability that there are at least $2(n - 1)$ edges in the network.}
