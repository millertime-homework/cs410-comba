% QUESTION 1
\paragraph{1. Consider building a network in the following way. Given $n$ 
machines, insert an edge between any pair of machines with probability $p = 
c/n$ for some $c \leq n$. For what value of $c$ is the expected number of edges 
$(n - 1)$? For this $c$, give the best upper bound you can on the probability 
that there are at least $2(n - 1)$ edges in the network.\\\\}

Let us define a random variable $X$ to represent the total number of edges. Let 
us also consider an individual edge between two machines. Let $X_i$ be an 
indicator random variable that is $1$ if and only if there is an edge between 
those two machines. Then $X$ will be a binomial random variable that is equal 
to the sum of these indicators.
\begin{equation*}
X = \sum_{i=1}^m X_i
\end{equation*}
where $m$ is the total number of combinations of 2 machines. We can see that $m 
= {n\choose 2}$.\\
Now we will find the expected number of edges $E[X]$.
\begin{equation*}
E[X] = E[\sum_{i=1}^{n\choose 2} X_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{n\choose 2} E[X_i] = 
{n\choose 2}p
\end{equation*}
We're told that $p=c/n$.
\begin{equation*}
E[X] = {n\choose 2}\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) = \frac{c(n-1)}{2}
\end{equation*}
In order to find $c$, let us assume that $E[X] = n-1$ and solve for $c$.
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{c(n-1)}{2} & = & n-1\\
c(n-1) & = & 2(n-1)\\
c & = & 2
\end{eqnarray*}

Let's get the variance of $X$ in attempt to find a good bound. The variance of 
a Binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$ is $np(1-p)$, but $X\sim 
B({n\choose 2},2/n)$.
\begin{equation*}
Var[X] = {n\choose 2}\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)(1-\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)) = 
	(n-1)(1-\left(\frac{2}{n}\right)) = \frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{n}
\end{equation*}
We now have a Chebyshev bound.
\begin{equation*}
Pr(|X-E[X]|\geq a) \leq \frac{Var[X]}{a^2}
\end{equation*}
We need to find $a$, and we're bounding the condition of $X \geq 2E[X]$. If 
$X=2E[X]$, then $X-E[X] = E[X] = a$.
\begin{equation*}
Pr(|X-E[X]| \geq E[X]) \leq \frac{Var[X]}{(E[X])^2} = 
\frac{\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{n}}{(n-1)^2} = \frac{n-2}{n(n-1)}
\end{equation*}

% QUESTION 2
\paragraph{2. Consider a graph $G = (V, E)$ with the following properties: 
there exists a partitioning of the vertex set $V$ into subsets $V_1$ and $V_2$ 
of sizes $r$ and $s$ (respectively); for all $x \in V_1$ and $y \in V_2$ there 
is an edge between $x$ and $y$; there are no edges between vertices in $V_1$, 
and no edges between vertices in $V_2$. Such a graph is denoted $K_{r,s}$ and 
is called a complete bipartite graph (with vertex partitioning into sets of 
size $r$ and $s$.) Clearly the number of edges in $K_{r,s}$ is $rs$.\\
Prove that there is a two-coloring of edges of $K_{r,s}$ with at most}
\begin{equation*}
{r\choose a}{s\choose b}2^{1-ab}
\end{equation*}
\textbf{monochromatic $K_{a,b}$ as subgraphs.}
